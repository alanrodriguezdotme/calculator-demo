# Calculator demo

A simple calculator I made with React (via Vite).

To try the demo, run these commands:

```
npm i
npm run dev
```

Then visit https://localhost:5173 in the browser to view the app.

## Features

- Focus tab order starts from top to bottom
- Added keyboard shortcuts
- Specific aria labels added for each button, tested with screen reader
- No third-party libraries used (other than Sass)

## Things I would improve

- Increase text opacity on buttons to improve contrast
- Add theming
- Add scientific calculator mode
